# Final Project Fitness NFC App (FitSmart)

The development of mobile applications has been an increasingly popular topic in recent years. The rise of smartphones and tablets has created a demand for applications that are user friendly, intuitive, and tailored to individual user needs. Fitness applications are among the most popular types of mobile applications, as they provide users with the ability to track their physical activity and monitor their progress.

Flutter is a framework for creating mobile applications that is becoming increasingly popular. It allows for rapid application development, and is compatible with both Android and iOS devices. Additionally, it is capable of using NFC technology, which allows for wireless data transfer between devices. This technology has the potential to provide users with a more accurate and user-friendly experience when using fitness applications.

The aim of this project is to examine the development of a fitness application built using Flutter that utilises NFC technology. The development process of the application will be discussed, including the technologies used, the challenges and issues encountered, and how they were addressed. Additionally, the usability of the application will be evaluated and suggestions for further development will be discussed.
